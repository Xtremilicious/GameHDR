# GameHDR

GameHDR is a user-friendly tool that allows you to create custom shortcuts for your favorite games with HDR (High Dynamic Range) enabled. 

This enables HDR on your monitor only while playing specific games.

**Note:** GameHDR is designed for Windows operating systems only. Tested for Windows 11 version 23H2.

## Features

- **Easy Shortcut Creation**: GameHDR simplifies the process of creating desktop shortcuts for games or any executables.
- **HDR Autostart**: Automatically enables HDR on your monitor when launching the game. HDR is disabled on your monitor once the game process ends.
- **Custom Icons**: Choose custom icons for your game shortcuts to personalize your desktop.

## How It Works

GameHDR uses a PowerShell script (`hdr.ps1`) to enable HDR on your monitor when you start the game. HDR on the monitor is disabled once the game process has ended. Simply select your game executable file, and GameHDR will create a desktop shortcut that launches the game with HDR enabled.

## Why HDR?

HDR (High Dynamic Range) technology in gaming enhances the overall visual quality of games by providing a wider range of colors and greater contrast between light and dark areas. It creates more realistic and immersive gaming experiences, bringing games to life like never before.

## Technical Details

**Note:** GameHDR is designed for Windows operating systems and requires Python to be installed on your computer.
